Step 1:

At $F063 and $F069, replace the instructions with 5 NOPs:

F063: 20 3A          BRA    $F09F
F065: 10 8E F0 6C    LDY    #$F06C
F069: 7E F2 BD       JMP    $F2BD

F063: 12             NOP
F064: 12             NOP          
F065: 10 8E F0 6C    LDY    #$F06C
F069: 12             NOP 
F06A: 12             NOP 
F06B: 12             NOP 

This will skip the RAM/ROM check, which will also prevent the watchdog from being triggered.

Step 2:

To get $2D2 bytes of ROM space, do the following:

Change the jump address at $F09D from 7E F1 FD to 7E 80 2E.

Paste the following data at $802E:
8E 58 00 30 1F C6 39 F7 CB FF 8C 00 00 26 F4 4A 26 EE 6E A4 12 12 53 59 4E 41 4D 41 58 20 4D 4F 44 12

Basically, we're taking the instructions located at $F1FD and rerouting it to copyright text at $802E.

The space from $F09F to $F370 can be used to insert new code.
